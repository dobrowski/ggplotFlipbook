Poll - how familiar are you with R and ggplot? 
- Just stayed from the last session and don't feel like moving
- Have dabbled but it isn't my go to tool
- I use them regularly and would like to learn something new
- I've led this presentation before

In chat, please write a question or something you hope to get out of today.

# Components of a graph

### + 

--

## aesthetics

--

### +

--

## geom 

???

These are the three components to creating a graph in ggplot, and arguable the grammar of graphing in any way even if not explicitly laid out.

These are building block of constructing a graph. Different ways to encode meaning, variables and data into geometric features.

We can go back to those there components that we discussed earlier and see how they were actualized in the graph we just made.

# Principle of Proportional Ink

--

### The sizes of shaded areas in a visualization need to be proportional to the data values they represent.

--

### Eliminate clutter

--

### Focus attention

`r chunk_reveal("first")`

```{r first, include = FALSE}


susp.green %>%
  filter(reporting_category == "TA") %>%
  ggplot( ) +

  aes(y = as.numeric( suspension_rate_total)/100) +

# Ease of modifcation and expansion

--

- Can tweak individual parts easily

--

- When making multiple graphs, only need to make change in one place

--

- Others can reproduce your steps


???

Image you made a graph that you liked.  Now imagine you have to do it for every school in your district or every school in the county.  Now for superintendent wants you to change the blue to light blue on every graph.  Now your colleague in San Diego wants to have it done for all of their schools.  

This is the power of using code to create the graphs and adaptability of ggplot.

# Notes: 

> **The flipbooked portion of this presentation was created with the {flipbookr} package.  Get it at remotes::install_github("EvaMaeRey/flipbookr")**

- In addition to creating flipbookr, Evangeline Reynolds inspired the approach to showing aspects of ggplot. https://evangelinereynolds.netlify.app/

- The formating was learned and inspired from Allison Hill https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html#1
