Poll - How familiar are you with R and ggplot? 
- I just stayed from the last session and don't feel like moving
- I have dabbled but it isn't my go to tool
- I use them regularly and would like to learn something new
- I've led this presentation before

In chat, please write a question or something you hope to get out of today.  


I'm also ok with questions throughout, as well as at the end.  If it is something about R in general or an involved discussion, I may hold that until later.

# Reasons Why to Graph Data

Start with why are we visualizing data? 

Studies have shown that people remember things better when given a picture in addition to text or numbers

Displaying visually allows use to see patterns we wouldn't necessarily get from summary statistics

# Components of a graph

???

ggplot's name comes from Hadley Wickham's Grammar of Graphics

His concept that there is an underlying grammar for creating visualizations and graphics. 

Everything we are going to do today is layering of additional elements are parts of speech.  

"The transferrable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncracies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive."

--

## data 

???

In general this needs to be in  a tidy format.  each column is a varialbe each case is a row.   


--

### + 

--

## aesthetics

???

philosophically it is about the nature of beauty and appearance, 

here it is useful to think about how you are asking the computer to arrange things


--

### +

--

## geom 

???

These are the geometric shapes you want to use. 

For instance, lines, points, rectangles, maps, etc. 

These are the three components to creating a graph in ggplot, and arguable the grammar of graphing in any way even if not explicitly laid out.

These are building block of constructing a graph. Different ways to encode meaning, variables and data into geometric features.

Next we are going to go through a real example.  


Based on the state's research files.  

Only looking at all students, for ELA in Grade 5 in 2019.  
Filtered for only the first 6 county codes, so Alameda through Colusa

Using an approach called SLOWggplot.  Bit by bit.  
This isn't the way you would normally write the code but you can see each individual addition.

---

name: scatter

`r chunk_reveal("intro")`

```{r intro, include = FALSE}

# Comparing Percent Exceeded and Scale Score

caaspp %>% # pipe
ggplot() +
  # Add axis
  aes(y = Percentage_Standard_Exceeded) +
  aes(x = Mean_Scale_Score)  +
  # Define geometric shapes
  geom_point() +
  # Define more, optional aesthetics
  aes(shape = County_Code ) + 
  aes(color = County_Code ) +
  aes(size = Students_Tested) +
  # Alpha is transparency
  aes(alpha = Percentage_Standard_Met_and_Above) +
  # Repeating will override
  aes(color = Mean_Scale_Score) +
  # Defining any details like legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")

We can go back to those there components that we discussed earlier and see how they were actualized in the graph we just made.

Looking at a real High School which there were concerns about suspension data

Start with a bar graph

`r chunk_reveal("first")`

```{r first, include = FALSE}


susp.green %>%
  filter(reporting_category == "TA") %>%
  ggplot( ) +
  aes(x = academic_year) +
  aes(y = as.numeric( suspension_rate_total)/100) +
  aes(group = school_name) +
  # New geom, same data
  geom_line( ) +
  aes(color = school_name) +
    labs(title = "Percentage Suspended in Emerald High \ncompared to California over time") +

# Ease of modifcation and expansion

--

- Can tweak individual parts easily

--

- When making multiple graphs, only need to make change in one place

--

- Others can reproduce your steps


???

Image you made a graph that you liked.  Now imagine you have to do it for every school in your district or every school in the county.  Now for superintendent wants you to change the blue to light blue on every graph.  Now your colleague in San Diego wants to have it done for all of their schools.  

This is the power of using code to create the graphs and adaptability of ggplot.

Themes help you adjust many elements all together.  

Here are a few themes that mimic popular settings in the world

```{r bar_revisit, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

  filter(reporting_category == "TA") %>% 
  ggplot( ) +
  aes(x = academic_year) +
  aes(y = as.numeric( suspension_rate_total)/100) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge" ) +
  aes(group = school_name) +
  aes(fill = school_name) +
    labs(title = "Percentage Suspended in Emerald High \ncompared to California over time") +
    labs(caption = "Source: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filessd.asp") + 
  scale_fill_colorblind() + #ROTATE
  scale_fill_gdocs() + #ROTATE
  scale_fill_few() + #ROTATE
  labs(x = "Academic Year")


```

Can easily change color palettes too



---

# Principle of Proportional Ink

--

### The sizes of shaded areas in a visualization need to be proportional to the data values they represent.

???

This is sometimes refered to as chartjunk.  

Think about it in terms of how do you help the viewer only think about what they need to and what is most important, and not trying to decipher your work.

--

### Eliminate clutter

--

### Focus attention

Can help determine the best graphs or geoms for your purpose. 

Not R specific.

I want to hear from you.  Please put in the chat, or share outloud sometihng you learned, unlearned or relearned

learned - new 

unlearned - something you have been doing that you want to change or was 'wrong' 

relearned - a reminder of something from before
